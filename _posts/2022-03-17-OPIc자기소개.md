## **Q. Let's start the interview now. Tell me a little about yourself.**

Hello. My name is Euichan, and I am 24 years old.   
I am currently looking for a job. My major was software. I chose this major because I would like to have a job in this field.   
I live with my brother in a Suwon. This is because my hometown is Changwon, so I can't live with my family. My parents live in Changwon. Sometimes I go to my hometown to see my parents.    
I think I am a social person. I really enjoy hanging out with my friends.   
When I have free time, I like to play games with my friends.
